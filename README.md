## License

We at A Softer Space really love the Unlicense, which pretty much allows anyone to do anything with this source code.
For more info, see the file UNLICENSE.

Our code being unlicensed is allowed as the only external thing we are using
is FFmpeg, which we don't include or link to, but we only call it via the commandline
to extract WAV files from videos and put a new video together afterwards - see
[here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5431/does-ffmpeg-lgpl-license-apply-in-case-if-application-is-using-ffmpeg-via-cli) and
[here](http://www.ffmpeg-archive.org/Can-I-use-FFmpeg-exe-command-line-in-my-proprietary-software-td3724787.html).

If you desperately need to use this source code under a different license, [contact us](mailto:moya@asofterspace.com) - I am sure we can figure something out.
